/*! Determines the cache storage policy for a response.
 *  \details When we provide a response up to the client we need to tell the client whether
 *  the response is cacheable or not.  The default HTTP/HTTPS protocol has a reasonable
 *  complex chunk of code to determine this, but we can't get at it.  Thus, we have to
 *  reimplement it ourselves.  This is split off into a separate file to emphasise that
 *  this is standard boilerplate that you probably don't need to look at.
 *  \param request The request that generated the response; must not be nil.
 *  \param response The response itself; must not be nil.
 *  \returns A cache storage policy to use.
